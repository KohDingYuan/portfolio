			<br>
			<p class="text-justify">The architecture uses a REST API for clear separation of concerns and modularity, essential for scalable and maintainable application development. The mobile app frontend is created with Flutter, while the backend API server is built using Django. This design enables independent operation of the frontend and backend, making updates and maintenance easier. Django functions solely as an API server handling requests and responses.<br><br>This improves the system's effectiveness by offloading data processing and business logic to the backend. The backend server interacts with a MySQL database, serving as the centralized data storage for the application. Using RESTful APIs ensures that communication between the frontend and backend is stateless, standardized, and easily scalable, enabling seamless handling of high loads and multiple client requests.<br><br>This architectural design supports flexibility by allowing independent development and scaling of the frontend while maintaining consistent and efficient communication through RESTful APIs.</p>

		<p class="text-justify">For this project, I was responsible for the technical leadership of a 10-person team in the development of a cross-platform mobile application intended to simplify the travel survey process, aligned with the requirements specified by our client, Nippon Koei Co., Ltd.<br><br>The mobile application was designed to collect GPS and Bluetooth connection logs, facilitating more convenient data sharing by respondents through a web-based questionnaire. By replacing the traditional door-to-door survey method, our solution enables more accurate and efficient data collection.<br><br>I also oversaw the integration of a web-based dashboard that allows administrators to manage surveys, accounts, and conduct data analysis. This dashboard interfaces with the mobile application via a Web API and supports cloud-based data storage.<br><br>The project's ultimate objective was to streamline the travel survey process, enhance the user experience, and contribute valuable data to support urban redevelopment and transportation improvement initiatives.<br><br>Our team emerged as the only group to present a working MVP that met all client requirements, and we further enhanced the solution with added complexity to improve its functionality and practicality. The final product not only met the client's needs but exceeded expectations, providing a robust and scalable solution for future use.</p>
